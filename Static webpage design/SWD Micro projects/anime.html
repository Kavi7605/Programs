      <h2 id="What is Anime?" style="font-family:serif;font-size: 210%;"><b>What is anime?</b>
      </h2>
      <p>Anime is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from <b>Japan.</b> In Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from the English word animation) describes all animated works, regardless of <b>style or origin.</b> However, outside of Japan and in English, anime is colloquial for Japanese animation and refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese animation is referred to as anime-influenced animation.
      </p>
      <img src="photos/anime1.jpg" width="400" height="320"><p><u>"OSAMU TEZUKA"</u></p>
      <p>The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to <b>1917.</b> A characteristic art style emerged in the <b>1960s</b> with the works of cartoonist <b>Osamu Tezuka</b> and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of <b>Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video games.</b> It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences.
      </p>

      <p>Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies. It combines graphic <b>art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques.</b>Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of <b>"camera effects",</b> such as panning, zooming, and angle shots. Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes.
      </p>

      <p>The anime industry consists of over <b>430 production companies</b>, including major studios like <b>Studio Ghibli, Sunrise,</b> and<b> Toei Animation.</b> Since the 1980s, the medium has also seen international success with the rise of foreign dubbed and subtitled programming. As of 2016, Japanese anime accounted for 60% of the world's animated television shows.

      <h2 id="How Anime Is Made?" style="font-family:courier;"><b><u>How Anime Is Made?</u></b></h2>
      <h3 style="font-family:courier;">Getting The Green Light</h3>
      <img src="photos/anime3.jpg" height="200" width="300">
      <p>Every anime has to start with a story idea. There are three main sources of story for anime: manga, light novels, and original scripts. Obviously, story ideas can come from anywhere, but popular manga and books in Japan make a lot of sense to use since they already have a fanbase.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, any story has to be converted to a script suitable for the anime medium; taking into account episodic length, story pacing, and other unique issues not faced by mangaka and novelists. The director, along with the writers, are key figures in getting the script into shape. Once the studio in question is happy with the script it will greenlight the project and pre-production will begin.</p>
      <h3 style="font-family:courier;">The Pre-production Phase</h3>
      <p>“Pre-production” is the phase of the project before anyone has actually started making the show. All film and television projects have a pre-production phase; the length of this can vary widely, based on several factors such as how big the project is going to be, how much money is needed, and so on. Pre-production begins from where the pitch or idea for a new anime happens up to the point where the animation itself is ready to start production. All the project planning and financial preparation happens here. Licensing of story rights, hiring of the right people, and getting investment from various sources are jobs done by the producers of the show.

      They are the ones who need to line everything up so the actual show can be made. It is a daunting task.
      </p>
      <p>The director plays an important role in this. He or she will be part of pre-production because they have the say when it comes to hiring the rest of production crew. Just as in Hollywood, to fill key positions directors will hire people they trust and have worked with before. Directors are the creative head of the project; not the business head. So they have to work with the budgets and deadlines agreed upon with the producers.
      </p>
      <p>Different studios have different staffing situations as well. There might be a core of in-house staff augmented by contractors as projects come and go. Once the money, people, and facilities are agreed upon the actual production part can begin.
      </p>
      <h3 style="font-family:courier;">A Word on Animation</h3>
      <p>In case you didn’t know, animation works by quickly flipping through drawings of different phases of motion in order to create the illusion of actual motion. Film works the same way, but each “frame” is a photograph rather than a drawing. I’m just mentioning it, because keeping the nature of animation in mind will allow the next phases to make more sense.</p>
      <h3 style="font-family:courier;">Storyboards</h3>
      <p>The script describes the story in terms of scenes and dialogue, but it’s not a visual representation. The director needs to turn the script into a visual guide in order to communicate to the animators exactly what he wants.
      </p>
      <img src="photos/anime4.jpg" height="400" weight="600">
      <p>That’s where a “storyboard” comes in. This is a set of rough sketches that detail what is meant to happen in each scene. It also shows what scene layouts should look like and so on. There may also be concept art if the story doesn’t already have visual design, as a manga would.
      </p>
      <h3 style="font-family:courier;">Key Animation</h3>
      <p>The layouts are given to the key animators. They will create the high-quality key frames. That is, the first and last frame of any smooth motion on screen, such as someone turning their head, pulling back for a punch, changing facial expression, and so on.
      </p>
      <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/65/f2/64/65f264c42da2bb6f9906735b1d7eb656.gif" alt="gif1">
      <p>The key frames are therefore the backbone of the animation and serve as a reference throughout the animation process. In order to create the illusion of smooth motion, films present us with 24 frames a second or more. This would imply that you need 24 drawings for each second of animation! Since there are typically only two or three key frames per second of anime, those extra frames have to come from somewhere.
      </p>
      <h3 style="font-family:courier;">In Between Artists</h3>
      <p>The unenviable job of drawing all those frames goes to another type of animator called an “in-between” artist. As you’ve probably figured out, this person draws all the frames between the key frames. This is a less senior artist and the work is often outsourced to cheap labor in places like South Korea. While the key frame artists have to actually create the original animation design and objects, the in-between artist has those key frames as reference, which makes their job easier, in principle. It’s still grueling work that requires a lot of talent. In-between artists are often very poorly paid, as are most people in the anime industry, to be honest.
      </p>
      <p>Luckily they don’t have to draw every single frame for every second of footage. Drawing a separate cel for every single frame in a given second is referred to as “animating on ones” in the industry. That sort of fluid motion is only reserved for big budget productions or for specific scenes (such as fights) that justify the extra effort. Most of the time, a show will be animated on “twos” or even “threes”. In other words, only every second or third frame is is animated.

      </p>
      <p>It’s with in-between animation that most quality issues arrive, and so they are all quality controlled by a dedicated supervisor. Still, some shows such as Naruto, with its insane production schedule, let some truly weird in-betweens slip through every now and then – something fans will capture and post on the internet with glee.
      </p>

      <h3 style="font-family:courier;">Going Digital</h3>
      <p>These days, regardless of how animation starts it inevitably ends up as digital media. Once the animation teams are done, everything needs to be colored. The colored cels are put against the backgrounds as per the layouts. In modern anime this is also where CG elements are added. Now everything must be filmed together as a composite to create the final video.
      </p>
      <h3 style="font-family:courier;">After Animation Ends</h3>
      <p>Anime aren’t silent movies! This means there’s still quite a lot to do. The voice artists need to breathe life into the characters, so final or near final animation is sent to the dubbing studio where voice tracks can be created. We still also need things like ambient sound, sound effects, music, and any other audio work such as mixing and mastering to be done.
      </p>
      <p>After all this work, your episode is basically ready to ship out, and then you get to start the whole process all over again!
      </p>
      <h3 style="font-family:courier;">For the Sake of Accuracy</h3>
      <p>I hope it’s clear that these are just the broad strokes of anime production. There’s a lot more fine detail that there simply isn’t space enough here to go through. This is also a sort of naive order and clinical description. In real life, anime projects can be chaotic and follow their own weird order and schedule. So don’t think of this as a recipe for making anime, but rather a list of main ingredients. Each studio will bake their anime in a different way.
      </p>
      <p>Things are also changing rapidly. There’s a move towards full CG animation, where 3D cel-shaded graphics are used for everything in the show. Sometimes this works very well, but many new CG anime shows (such as the Berserk reboot) look pretty awful. It’s a technology that studios are only slowly learning to use properly. When done right, such as in Knights of Sidonia, it can look great. However, there will always be a certain charm to hand-drawn 2D characters.
      </p>
      <p>Making anime is largely a thankless job. Japanese animators get paid very little and have to work brutal hours; yet they possess amazing artistic talent. This is not a career you get into to make a ton of money. It’s an art driven by passion, and knowing how this particular sausage is made helps us appreciate it even more.
      </p>
      <h2 id="How Anime Has Evolved Though The Years" style="font-family:courier;"><b><u>How Anime Has Evolved Though The Years</u></b></h2>
      <p>Since it first appeared in 1917, anime — or Japanese animation — has grown as both a commercial industry and an art form.
      <p style="background-color:Tomato;"> The evolution of anime occurred in stages, starting with cutout animation and silent short films, expanding through government-sanctioned propaganda, then moving toward longer, more creative works influenced by Disney, but that took on looks of their own.</p> With the introduction of new genres like sports and mecha anime, animation techniques like CGI, changes in art style trends, and the global access of online streaming available to today's viewers, anime has evolved into a dynamic and progressive media form.
      </p>
      <p>Seeing anime's evolution over the course of its over hundred-year history is a fascinating dive into how culture, politics, art, and globalization ebb and flow. Luckily, anime continues to create and expand — even Netflix is creating original anime — ensuring new generations will continue to benefit from the discourse and entertainment sparked by Japanese animation.

      </p>
      <h3 style="font-family:courier;"><b><u>Anime Is More Than 100 Years Old</u></b></h3>
      <p>Anime may seem like a modern invention, but it actually has a history stretching back more than 100 years to the early part of the 20th century. The first anime — a short titled Namakura Gatana (The Dull Sword) made by artist Jun'ichi Kōuchi — went into production in 1917 during the era of silent film. The artist created it using experimental cutout animation techniques.
      </p>
      <img src="https://i.makeagif.com/media/5-09-2017/9h1uYQ.gif"><p>"Namakura Gatana"</p>
      <p>Soon other artists followed suit. Animated short films from France and the USA inspired many of the early Japanese works. While they were generally considered to be quite well done, they were expensive and time-consuming to make. Moreover, they didn't gain the popularity that, for example, Disney animations did — in part because they were still mostly silent and in black and white when other media moved to color and sound.
      </p>
      <h3 style="font-family:courier;"><b><u>1963's 'Astro Boy' Was The First Televised Anime</u></b></h3>
      <p>Because the arrival of anime predated the invention of television, the first anime to make it onto the small screen was far from the first anime to exist. But what was that milestone series? Tetsuwan Atomu, known to American audiences as Astro Boy, aired on Fuji Television on January 1, 1963.
      </p>
      <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/cd/0e/01/cd0e01d3c42f20c36241058e9e6b694b.jpg" height="200" weight="350">
      <p>For its time, Astro Boy was pretty incredible, but it could have been a lot better. Unfortunately, because the studio was so poorly funded, the show's creators had to do whatever they could to minimize the number of drawings and lines required, and to create a sense of movement through sound and dialogue as opposed to actually having the characters move. This was far from ideal, but it did display the creativity that carried the anime industry into the future.
      </p>
      <h3 style="font-family:courier;"><b><u>Anime Ideas Traditionally Came From Classic Novels And Manga</u></b></h3>
      <p>Ideas for anime have always come from a variety of places. In the 1960s and '70s, it was common to base anime on works of classic literature, especially Western literature. Alps no Shojo Heidi (Heidi, Girl of the Alps) is a classic '70s example. While this still occurs, modern anime is far more likely to use manga, light novels, or video games as its source material. Anime studios also come up with wholly unique ideas that sometimes even turn into entire genres.
      </p>
      <img src=""height="150" weight="350" >
      <p>Anime from the 2000s branches out in ways that would have been impossible in the past. One-Punch Man, one of the most popular anime to appear in recent years, takes its inspiration from a webcomic.

      <h1 id="5 Reasons why people like anime" style="font-family:courier;"><b><u>5 Reasons why people like anime</u></b></h1>
      <h3 style="font-family:courier;"><b>1.The characters are unique and interesting</b></h3>
      <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/c3f9de0c2e3376384d86cf6d1dbc17b6/82878dc3a22b9787-aa/s500x750/ec9e23c58e4430bea5055ef8f4182e360a90c0ed.gifv" height="300" weight="500">
      <p>Anime boasts such vibrancy and diversity in its characters. People in anime have dynamic personalities, they’re whole people (even when they aren’t human); they have dreams and goals, and beyond that, there’s just so much variance in what they are. Ghosts, detectives, ghouls, pirates, demons, high school students, office workers… the list goes on, and there’s no limit to what a character might be, or who they might be.</p>
      <h3 style="font-family:courier;"><b>2.Characters have flaws and die</b></h3>
      <img src="https://c.tenor.com/PpbZ1H133L0AAAAd/chifuyu-tokyo-revengers-death.gif" height="300" weight="500">
      <p>Sort of the flip side of number 2 is that characters in anime are not spared by plot armour. Even a character that is absolutely pivotal to the plotline is not immune to death, or flaws. Perfect characters don’t exist in anime, and if they do exist, it’s usually because it’s being set up to prove a plot point.</p>
      <h3 style="font-family:courier;"><b>3.Anime is relatable</b></h3>
      <img src="https://c.tenor.com/LiXuc1T8ViUAAAAd/orange-anime-kakeru-naruse.gif" alt="lol" height="300" weight="500">
      <p>Not the storylines specifically, but just because something is animated, doesn’t mean it can be realistic or relatable. Most animes will harbour serious moral philosophies from real-life situations. And things like decision-making, the ability to overcoming loss, and the importance of familial relationships form the corner-stone of almost any anime you watch.</p>
      <h3 style="font-family:courier;"><b>4.Strong female characters</b></h3>
      <img src="https://c.tenor.com/pP8lIq8seWcAAAAd/nezuko-kamado-kimetsu-no-yaiba.gif" height="300" weight="500">
      <p>There’s a bit of a misconception about the way anime portrays women, but I’m here to tell you that physicality aside, women in anime are not there as male fan service. They are strong, dynamic characters—no damsels in distress here (well, mostly)! Women in anime go toe-to-toe with males in action sequences and are just as likely to kick-ass and take names as any of the guys.</p>
      <h3 style="font-family:courier;"><b>5.There are ENDLESS possibilities</b></h3>
      <img src="https://c.tenor.com/YNhKSlGrgxsAAAAC/one-piece-luffy.gif" alt="kuchbhi">
      <p>What’s the most random story you can think of? There’s probably an anime for that. School of compulsive gamblers? Check. Universe where humans co-exist with any number of mythical creatures? Check. Journeys of a guy who eats a magical fruit and is trying to become the Pirate King? Check. There are no limitations on what worlds or characters exist, it’s truly astounding</p>
